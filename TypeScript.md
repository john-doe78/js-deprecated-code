Hello Sir,

I hope this message finds you well! I'm excited to apply for the Trainee Python Developer position at Kolpolok Limited. With hands-on experience in Django, Django REST Framework, and PostgreSQL, I’m passionate about building clean, efficient backend systems that solve real-world problems.

During my internship at REPLIQ Limited, I optimized database queries and designed API endpoints for HRPro, improving the application's performance and reliability. I am also eager to learn from experienced developers and contribute to your team while further developing my skills.

Please find my resume attached for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Kolpolok’s success. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
